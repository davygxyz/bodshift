		<p>The overall goal of this site is to motivate people. 
		We don’t care if you’re underweight, overweight, average or any other body 
		types we forgot. We want to build a community of people willing to show the world 
		their wonderful transformations. Remember, who is in control of their body? The answer is you. 
		Doesn’t matter what anyone says, people can help you along the way but it’s up to you to take 
		the advice.
